### What I Learned from Completing This Project

1. **Fully Responsive Design**:
   - I learned how to build a website that is fully responsive across all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS. This includes designing layouts that adapt to both mobile and desktop screens, ensuring a seamless user experience regardless of the device.

2. **UI/UX Design**:
   - I gained hands-on experience with user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, focusing on making the website visually appealing and easy to navigate. This includes styling elements such as buttons, images, and navigation menus, as well as ensuring accessibility for all users.
   
3. **State Management in React**:
   - I utilized Reactâ€™s `useState` and other state management techniques to create interactive components, such as dynamically updating the Hero section when users select different travel classes or trip types.

4. **Mobile-First Development**:
   - I applied a mobile-first approach by initially designing for smaller screens and progressively enhancing the design for larger devices using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities.

5. **Improved Accessibility**:
   - I focused on making the website more accessible by implementing best practices, such as adding `aria-labels`, `alt` text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigability for all interactive elements.
